***************************************************************************************************************************
__StraTistiX__  is my fork (https://github.com/KamensekD/StraTistiX) based on Thomas Champagne's __StravistiX__ Strava Chrome Extension.
It contains all the functionality of StravistiX PLUS some additional goodies and tweaks that are based on my ideas and preferences that suit me; they might or might not suit You and/or Thomas; just try and see! I try to fix any bugs found in StravistiX and, of course, also might introduce some new :)
aRPEe Score concept was developed and designed by myself based on lots of my workouts; it mostly seems to acurately describe how hard my workouts were.
From time to time I'll try to merge interesting new stuff from Thomas's updates of his base repository; any developer can also freely take anything from my repository and use it in non-commercial manner; when using __aRPEe Score__, please link to this repository and/or extension; most kudos for the whole concept go to Thomas Champagne!
